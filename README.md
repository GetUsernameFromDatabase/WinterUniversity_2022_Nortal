# DEVELOPER TEST TASK

## Winter University 2022

And the challenge begins.

Each subdirectory here represents one piece of the test assignment. Each of these pieces is independent,
contains its own Readme.docx and can be solved separately. Solve as much as you can - a partial solution is
better than no solution. In addition to making your code work, make it pretty as well.

Good luck!

### Submitting Assignment

Once you have completed your development, run “gradlew.bat createSubmissionZip” in the root directory,
where this Readme.docx resides. Your results will be packed to assignment_submit.zip under build/ directory.
This is the file you need to upload.
